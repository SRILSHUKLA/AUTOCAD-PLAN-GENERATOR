# AutoPlan AI

## Overview

AutoPlan AI is a web application that converts architectural floor plans into editable CAD files (DXF format). Using advanced AI technology, it automatically detects walls, doors, windows, and other architectural elements from uploaded floor plan images and generates precise CAD files that can be edited in any CAD software.

## Features

- **Instant Floor Plan Conversion**: Transform images of floor plans into editable CAD files
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Automatically recognizes walls, doors, windows, and other architectural elements
- **DXF Output Format**: Industry-standard output compatible with all CAD software
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Beautiful and intuitive design with interactive elements
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Three.js for 3D background animation
- GSAP for smooth animations
- Font Awesome for icons

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: Drag and drop or browse to select your floor plan image
2. **Processing**: Our AI analyzes the image to detect architectural elements
3. **Download**: Receive your DXF file ready for use in your preferred CAD software
4. **Edit**: Open the file in AutoCAD, LibreCAD, or any other CAD program to make adjustments

## Installation

No installation required! AutoPlan AI is a web-based application accessible through any modern browser.

If you want to run the project locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SRILSHUKLA/AUTOCAD-PLAN-GENERATOR.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd AUTOCAD-PLAN-GENERATOR
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

1. Visit the website
2. Upload your floor plan image (PNG, JPG, or PDF)
3. Wait for the AI to process your image
4. Download the resulting DXF file

## Limitations

- Best results are achieved with clear, high-resolution floor plan images
- Hand-drawn plans may have lower accuracy than digital plans
- Complex curved elements might require manual adjustments after conversion

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional output formats (SVG, PDF)
- Multi-floor processing
- Custom element tagging
- Dimension detection and scaling
- 3D model generation
