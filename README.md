## Overview

**DraftEase** is a web-based tool that converts architectural floor plan images into editable CAD files (DXF format). Instead of relying on AI, DraftEase uses a custom algorithmic approach to trace architectural elements such as walls and rooms from clear floor plan images, making the output reliable and lightweight.

## Features

- **Image-to-CAD Conversion**: Upload floor plan images and convert them to DXF format
- **Algorithmic Tracing Engine**: Detects structure outlines using traditional computer vision techniques
- **Fast and Lightweight**: No heavy AI models, runs efficiently even on basic setups
- **Editable CAD Output**: Generated DXF files are compatible with all major CAD software
- **Intuitive UI**: Drag-and-drop upload and instant download of output files

## Dataset Attribution

This project utilizes floor plan samples collected by Cubicasa5K dataset for development and testing.
Cubicasa5K is a high-quality floorplan dataset provided for research purposes.
The CubiCasa5K dataset was introduced in the following paper:

"CubiCasa5k: A Dataset and an Improved Multi-Task Model for Floorplan Image Analysis"
P. Renevey, O. Loosli, M. R. Oswald, and R. G. Cavallaro
International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), 2020.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Flask)
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- OpenCV and PIL for image processing
- DXF writing using `ezdxf` or custom tracing logic

## üîß How It Works  
### - Uploading & Converting Floor Plan Images  
1. **Upload** ‚Üí Select a clean floor plan image (PNG, JPG).  
2. **Trace** ‚Üí The backend processes the image and extracts architectural outlines.  
3. **Convert** ‚Üí The traced shapes are converted into DXF file elements.  
4. **Download** ‚Üí Instantly download the DXF for editing in AutoCAD or similar CAD software.  

### - Generating Custom Floor Plans  
1. **Specify** ‚Üí Enter room types, dimensions, and layout preferences.  
2. **Generate** ‚Üí Our model creates a floor plan matching your requirements.  
3. **Download** ‚Üí Export the auto-generated DXF file to refine in AutoCAD.

## Installation

To run DraftEase locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SRILSHUKLA/AUTOCAD-PLAN-GENERATOR.git
cd AUTOCAD-PLAN-GENERATOR
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
